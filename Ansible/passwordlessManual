On the client (where you ssh FROM)

First make a ssh key with no password. I highly suggest you give it a name rather then using the default

ssh-keygen -f foo


edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config


Make sure you allow root to log in with the following syntax

PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin yes

Restart the server

sudo service ssh restart

Set a root password use a strong

sudo passwd

Transfer the key to the server

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/foo root@server

Test

ssh -i ~/.ssh/foo root@server

unset a root password and disable password login.
On the server :

sudo passwd -l root

Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Change the following :

PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin without-password

Restart the server

sudo service ssh restart
